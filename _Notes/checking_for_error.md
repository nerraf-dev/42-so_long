I need help to check something here please. in `set_wall_texture_values` I populate the array of `t_img` values with the filename. Then for each of the elements `set_img_data` loads and populates the other properties in the t_img structure via mlx function calls. i think that here if there is an error it is handled. No filename - error message; if the *img data is null - error message; if the buffer fails then the *img value in the structure is destroyed. all return a 1 so in the texture value function, if `set_img_data` is 1, that function has already put an error to the terminal and cleaned any memory used. DO i need further clean up here? currently (excluding the parsing part as that has been tested and i beleive in a working state) if the UI closes via ESC or the UI button, it closes gracefully. But this is due to me destroying images once used
